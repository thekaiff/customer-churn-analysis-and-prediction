      <h2 align="center">Executive Summary</h2>
      <body>
        Customer churn is one of the most critical revenue leakage problems in subscription-based businesses.  
        In this project, I built an <strong>end-to-end Customer Churn Analytics & Prediction solution</strong> that combines
        <strong>exploratory data analysis, business intelligence dashboards, and machine learning predictions</strong> to help stakeholders
        identify <strong>who is churning, why they are churning, and who is likely to churn next</strong>.
        <br><br>
        Using historical customer behavior, demographic attributes, account information, and service usage patterns,
        this analysis reveals <strong>high-risk churn segments</strong> and provides <strong>actionable, data-backed retention strategies</strong>.
        <br><br>
        The final output is a <strong>Power BI executive dashboard</strong> integrated with
        <strong>ML-driven churn predictions</strong>, enabling leadership teams to move from
        <strong>reactive churn reporting → proactive churn prevention</strong>.

  <h3>High-Impact Business Outcomes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Identified <strong>high-risk churn segments</strong> across demographics, geography, and contract types</li>
        <li>Built a <strong>predictive churn model</strong> to flag customers before they churn</li>
        <li>Enabled <strong>targeted retention strategies</strong> instead of blanket discounts</li>
        <li>Designed a <strong>stakeholder-ready Power BI dashboard</strong> for decision-making</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 align="center">Business Problem</h2>
      <body>
        The business was experiencing <strong>rising customer churn</strong> but lacked clarity on:
        <br><br>
        • Which customer segments are churning the most?  
        • What behavioral or account factors drive churn?  
        • Which customers are at risk of churning next month?  
        • Where should retention budgets be focused for maximum ROI?
        <br><br>
        Traditional reporting only explained <strong>past churn</strong>.  
        Stakeholders needed a <strong>forward-looking churn intelligence system</strong>.

<h1 align="center">Insights Deep Dive</h1>

<h3>1️⃣ Demographic Insights</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female customers show a higher churn concentration compared to males</li>
  <li><strong>Age Groups:</strong> Mid-age customers (working professionals) contribute the highest churn volume</li>
  <li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single customers churn more frequently than married customers</li>
</ul>

<h3>2️⃣ Account & Contract Insights</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Payment Method:</strong> Customers using electronic checks show significantly higher churn</li>
  <li><strong>Contract Type:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Month-to-month contracts have the <strong>highest churn rate</strong></li>
      <li>Long-term contracts (1–2 years) show much better retention</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Tenure:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>New customers (0–12 months) are the most vulnerable churn group</li>
      <li>Churn probability decreases as tenure increases</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>3️⃣ Revenue & Behavioral Insights</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Churners typically have <strong>higher monthly charges</strong> but lower long-term value</li>
  <li>Customers with <strong>low referrals</strong> show higher churn probability</li>
  <li>Refund-heavy customers correlate strongly with churn behavior</li>
</ul>

<h3>4️⃣ Geographic Insights</h3>
<ul>
