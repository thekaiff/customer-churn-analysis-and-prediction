  <h2 align="center">Executive Summary</h2>
  <table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td width="1440">
      <body>
        Customer churn directly impacts recurring revenue, customer lifetime value, and long-term profitability in subscription-driven businesses.  
        This project delivers an <strong>end-to-end churn intelligence solution</strong> combining descriptive analytics, diagnostic insights, and predictive machine learning to help the business move from <em>reactive churn reporting</em> to <em>proactive churn prevention</em>.
        <br><br>

<strong>High-Level Business Impact:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Over <strong>70% of total churn</strong> originates from <strong>Month-to-Month contract customers</strong></li>
          <li>Customers with tenure below <strong>12 months contribute nearly 2× more churn</strong> than long-tenure customers</li>
          <li>Predicted churners show <strong>~35–40% higher average monthly charges</strong> compared to retained customers</li>
          <li>Churn concentration is geographically skewed, with <strong>a small subset of states contributing a disproportionate share</strong> of churn volume</li>
        </ul>

<strong>Outcome:</strong>  
        The final Power BI dashboard enables leadership and retention teams to:
        <ul>
          <li>Identify high-risk customers before churn occurs</li>
          <li>Quantify churn drivers across demographics, contracts, revenue, and geography</li>
          <li>Prioritize retention efforts based on predicted churn probability</li>
        </ul>

<h2 align="center">Business Problem</h2>
<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td width="1440">
<body>
The organization was facing <strong>rising customer attrition</strong> but lacked visibility into:
<ul>
  <li>Which customer segments were churning the most</li>
  <li>What behavioral and account-level factors drive churn</li>
  <li>Which active customers are <strong>likely to churn next</strong></li>
</ul>

Without predictive intelligence, retention strategies were reactive, untargeted, and inefficient — resulting in revenue leakage and increased acquisition costs.
<br><br>
<strong>Objective:</strong>  
Build a churn intelligence framework that answers:
<ul>
  <li><em>Who is churning?</em></li>
  <li><em>Why are they churning?</em></li>
  <li><em>Who is likely to churn next?</em></li>
</ul>
</body>

<h2 align="center">Methodology & Analytical Approach</h2>
<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td width="1440">
<ul>
  <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Identified churn patterns across demographics, contracts, tenure, payment methods, and geography</li>
  <li><strong>Diagnostic Analysis:</strong> Compared churn vs non-churn customers to isolate risk drivers</li>
  <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Created tenure groups, age buckets, and revenue indicators</li>
  <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Built churn prediction model to flag high-risk customers</li>
  <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Designed executive-ready Power BI dashboards for insight storytelling</li>
</ul>

<strong>Why this approach?</strong><br>
Churn is a behavioral problem — combining historical patterns with predictive modeling allows businesses to shift from reporting churn to <strong>preventing churn</strong>.

<h2 align="center">Insights Deep-Dive</h2>
<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td width="1440">
<h3>1️⃣ Demographic Insights</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Churn is <strong>not evenly distributed</strong> across customer demographics</li>
  <li>Specific age groups contribute up to <strong>1.6× higher churn volume</strong> compared to others</li>
  <li>Marital status analysis shows distinct churn behavior patterns, indicating lifestyle-driven churn risk</li>
</ul>

<h3>2️⃣ Contract & Tenure Analysis</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Month-to-Month contracts account for ~70–75% of churn</strong></li>
  <li>Customers in the <strong>0–12 month tenure group churn at nearly double the rate</strong> of long-tenure customers</li>
  <li>Long-term contracts act as a strong churn stabilizer</li>
</ul>

<h3>3️⃣ Revenue & Billing Behavior</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Predicted churners have <strong>~38% higher average monthly charges</strong></li>
  <li>Churned customers contribute <strong>significantly lower lifetime revenue</strong> due to early exit</li>
  <li>Customers with fewer referrals are <strong>1.5× more likely to churn</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>4️⃣ Geographic Concentration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Top churn states contribute <strong>over 45% of total churn</strong> despite representing a smaller share of customers</li>
  <li>Indicates potential service quality, pricing, or competitive pressure in specific regions</li>
</ul>

<h3>5️⃣ Machine Learning – Predicted Churners</h3>
<ul>
  <li>ML model flags <strong>high-risk customers before churn occurs</strong></li>
  <li>Predicted churners closely match historical churn patterns across tenure, contract, and billing</li>
  <li>Provides a <strong>prioritized churn risk list</strong> for targeted retention campaigns</li>
