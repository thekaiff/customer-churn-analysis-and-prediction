      <h2 align="center">Client Background</h2>
      <body>
        <strong>The client</strong> is a mid-sized telecommunications service provider operating across multiple U.S. states, serving a diverse residential customer base. Over recent quarters, the company experienced a noticeable increase in customer attrition, directly impacting recurring revenue and customer lifetime value (CLV).  
        <br><br>
        With a growing subscriber base and rising acquisition costs, leadership required a <strong>data-driven churn analysis</strong> to understand <strong>why customers leave, who is most at risk, and where proactive retention efforts should be focused</strong>.
        <br><br>
        Reporting to senior business stakeholders, this project delivers a <strong>full-cycle churn analytics solution</strong> — combining <strong>descriptive analytics, diagnostic insights, and machine learning–driven churn prediction</strong> using Power BI, SQL, Python, and supervised learning models.

          <strong>Business Problem</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Churn was disproportionately high among specific customer segments, but root causes were unclear.</li>
            <li>Retention strategies were reactive rather than predictive.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

  <li>
          <strong>Solution Delivered</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Built an interactive <strong>Power BI churn dashboard</strong> with drill-downs across demographics, account behavior, and geography.</li>
            <li>Developed a <strong>machine learning churn prediction model</strong> to proactively flag high-risk customers.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

  <li>
          <strong>Quantified Impact</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Identified <strong>high-risk churn segment contributing over 60% of predicted churn</strong>.</li>
            <li>Customers on <strong>month-to-month contracts showed ~3x higher churn risk</strong> than long-term contracts.</li>
            <li>High monthly charges combined with short tenure formed the <strong>strongest churn signal</strong>.</li>

<h1 align="center">Business Problem</h1>
<body>
The organization lacked clarity on <strong>which customers were likely to churn and why</strong>. Existing reports were descriptive but failed to:
<ul>
  <li>Explain churn drivers across customer demographics and contracts</li>
  <li>Quantify revenue loss due to churn</li>
  <li>Predict churn before it occurred</li>
</ul>
The goal was to transform raw customer data into <strong>actionable retention intelligence</strong>.

<h1 align="center">Key Insights & Results</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Contract Type:</strong> Month-to-month customers represent the highest churn risk segment.</li>
  <li><strong>Tenure:</strong> Customers with tenure under 12 months show significantly higher churn probability.</li>
  <li><strong>Pricing Sensitivity:</strong> High monthly charges without long-term contracts accelerate churn.</li>
  <li><strong>Demographics:</strong> Specific age groups and marital segments display elevated churn patterns.</li>
  <li><strong>Geography:</strong> Certain states consistently show higher churn concentration.</li>
  <li><strong>ML Output:</strong> Predicted churners represent a <strong>material portion of monthly recurring revenue at risk</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 align="center">Business Recommendations</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Introduce <strong>contract conversion incentives</strong> for month-to-month customers.</li>
  <li>Launch <strong>early-tenure engagement programs</strong> within the first 90 days.</li>
  <li>Implement <strong>dynamic pricing or loyalty benefits</strong> for high-value customers.</li>
  <li>Deploy ML predictions into CRM systems for <strong>proactive churn intervention</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 align="center">Next Steps</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Integrate churn predictions with real-time customer activity data.</li>
  <li>Expand model with behavioral usage metrics.</li>
  <li>Track post-intervention churn reduction to measure ROI.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h1 align="center">Limitations & Learnings</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Model performance is limited by historical feature availability.</li>
  <li>Behavioral usage data could further improve prediction accuracy.</li>
  <li>Reinforced the importance of aligning analytics with business decisions, not just metrics.</li>
